Books
=========================================================================

Automaticallly generate redirecting 'index.html' for books that don't have an index

Some things automatically set behind the scenes:
toc: true
documentclass: book

TODO: pull front matter out of md files (emit title as '# Title')
TODO: emit section markdown (and or \part)

TODO: Parts
TODO: Appendixes (uses letter numbering by default)


TODO: centralize error cleanup and consider caching


- we need section cross refs to NOT require section numbering. links to sections need to be global
  HTML books you need to use crossrefs
- [Another option is that we resolve .md#foobar to just be #foobar  @sec:asdfasdf]

- For HTML output, we want to execute pandoc for each file, however some things are effectively "global":
    - cross references
        - persist the index across all pandoc renders (esolveRefs in a separate pass at the end)
        - paste together all of of the markdown and run the filters on it, then run pandoc without the filters on each file
    - bibliography 
        - per page option?
        - global: 
            - collect up every key that is used anywhere in the book
            - tell pandoc to create a page using those keys
            - hide the bibliography in the individual chapters
            - fixup up the citation links to point to the bibliography

- Should seriously consider whether HTML should also be pasted together. If we do the global render followed by split, 
  then we need to save out the dependencies and htmlPreserve and apply it per file

- Incremental render uses the freezer

- Running all markdown files as one pandoc render (pdf, epub, asciidoc, whatever)
    - we need to render one format at a time
    - we need to accumulate a set of executeResults (it would be nice if only one place computed the filesDir)
    - we need to feed all of those executeResults back to pandoc together 
         - concatenate the dependencies and resolve them in one step
         - concatenate the markdown (fixup relative references -- the md file needs a marker e.g. a comment to indicate the offset)
           (done in a lua filter)
         - there needs to be a source of front-matter for that file (derived from _quarto.yml)
         - (if there is front-matter in chapters e.g. for web output, we need to strip it out of the markdown)
    - then we run the preserve step with an array of preserves
    - visual editor needs to use the full path to chapters for the id-prefix for footnotes


IDE/Docs unlock users actually using this and engaging with it



RStudio IDE
=====================================================================

- New project type: "quarto"
- Introduce "Render on Save" 
- Automatically use quarto render when in quarto project (unless 'output: ')
- Crossrefs 
- Divs
- Run dev server on startup? Automatically disable external/viewer preview when dev server running
- When running the dev server, the "Preview" or "Render" button for .md just saves and brings Viewer to front


- webshot equivalent for printed output

- Glossaries (https://jupyterbook.org/content/content-blocks.html#glossaries)
- Indexes (equivalent of \makeindex)
{{ pagebreak }}
{{ makeindex }}
[span]{index="foo"}


- Concept of non-HTML themes (e.g. LaTeX template, docx template)


- projects: shell command to run before/after render or per-file render

- localization?


HTML Format (all these require grid, all need to deal with floating toc)
- Sidebar content (https://jupyterbook.org/content/layout.html#sidebars-within-content)
- Margin content (once we are using CSS grid) https://jupyterbook.org/content/layout.html#margin-content
- Full width content (https://jupyterbook.org/content/layout.html#full-width-code-cells)
- Figure captions in the right margin
- fig.classes (knitr mapping, jupyter)

Renders have side effects (knit_meta) that need to be preserved for books.
The side effects might require an id of some kind (for managing duplicates):
   R: 
     - html dependencies
     - preserves
     - patches (e.g. slides for htmlwidgets)
     - intermediates/intermediates-dir

HIGHER PRIORITY BACKGROUND WORK

TODO: Support collapsing - expand only to show current node (bookdown has option we can look at)


LOWER PRIORITY BACKGROUND WORK



callouts
==========================================
TODO: Allow user to provide a custom emoji for a callout. 
TODO: If supporting emoji easy to support color too
TODO: could allow definition of callout types (emoji + color) and automatically generate css to format them
      - what about latex / asciidoc :(
callout-types:
  - name: my-custom-type
    category: info
    emoji: emoji
    color: red
:::{.callout-my-custom-type} 
This is a custom callout

      - need to deal with thematic render
TODO ensure that when wide, we try bumping up font size slightly

navigation
==============================================

Logging
=========================================================================
// TODO: Verbose support?

TinyTex
============================================================================
Tinytex install should optionally accept a version (?)
Create bundled standalone version
Consider consolidating the main loop (single loop rather than pdf compile followed by loop)

Could say that while there is *always* a lockfile, package installations
are always global (b/c they popuplate the global cache). the only local
thing you need is the deps.ts / import_map.json, etc.

extensions:
  fancytweet: https://quarto.land/fancytweet@3.4.2
  

TODO: multi-lingual sites
        - top-level content directories:  en/, zh/, per-language config (menus)



{{ fancytweet qwerqwer }}


quarto install fancytweet

quarto update fancytweet

for standalone document render, we will promot for installation of extensions
as necessary, and add the extensions: key in YAML at the bottom of the document

- install/update commands put the latest version in the global cache
- new documents use the latest version in the cache
- if you run install/update within a project then it updates the lockfile

Extensions sources:
  - global cache
  - project lockfile
  - 'extensions' inside a yaml key

A 'format' is a director or zip file which is:
  - Located in the _quarto directory
  - Format YAML (must declare base)
  - Arbitrary other files that can be referenced (relatively) by the format YAML


# paged.js format

Port a dozen or rticles formats  (collect feedback, currently maintaining templates is unweildy)
  - Authors metadata standard 
  - Shared schema

# standalone document formats



metadata:
   - Inline YAML in code chunks
       - https://gist.github.com/jjallaire/a315f08ba5007678f3f8cbcb093cafb4
       - PR for jupytext to support the same for md:markdown
       - PR for knitr so that knitr::purl ignores the front matter
       - RStudio also needs to ignore the front matter

Cleanup
--------------------------------------------

Extracate the cache dir logic from rmarkdown::render and call that


discover index.Rmd or ui.Rmd for quarto run. can't rely on
rmarkdown::run b/c we need to figure out which Rmd to render




Future
---------------------------------------------

- Evaluate esbuild

- Consider yaml for chunk options
    * knitr
    * jupytext pr


Julia Dev workflow

- Make sure that Revise.jl is loaded at startup https://timholy.github.io/Revise.jl/stable/

- Run Julia in Quarto dir

- Switch to pkg mode "]" and execute "dev ."

- Exit pkg mode (backspace)

- using Quarto

- changes should show up automatically now



Future - Charles
---------------------------------------------

Windows:
- Continue to monitor Cliffy + Deno versions for Windows support.
  Unpinned Cliffy was causing an error when running bundled version (e.g. installed version) on Windows
  Deno 1.8.1+ currently stack overflows when bundling on windows
