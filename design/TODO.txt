---------------------------

- We are spewing temp files that never get cleaned up

- (Ubuntu) Quitting from lines 9-10 (test.Rmd) 
Error in UseMethod("wrap", x) : 
  no applicable method for 'wrap' applied to an object of class "list"
Calls: .main ... call_block -> block_exec -> unlist -> wrap -> knitr_wrap


- Jupyter performance / kernel startup time
  Tornado has no dependencies and supports autoreload:
      https://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/autoreload.html 
      may be able to do this (where the script auto kills the server): python -m tornado.autoreload tornado/test/runtests.py

Project system:
  - allow _quarto config directory that merges all contained files
    (lock file will go there as well)
  - See MkDocs: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Lp39BolpTR0NzbQQ6ebr9bawYth8EeivBo0q4qapVY/edit#heading=h.ibf8kici39py
  - Terminate at _quarto.yml w/ project: true
    (need to first determine if there is a project somewhere in the parent tree,
     if there is, then use this behavior, if not, use the first match)
  - External interactions with projects (output_dir, clean, etc.)
  - website / book format variations

- We don't seem to be able to render latex quite the same way that knitr does,
e.g.:
library(flextable)
ft <- flextable(head(mtcars))
ft <- autofit(ft)
ft
- Why did Beamer fail to render w/ missing caption package w/ our pipeline but work for pandoc pdflatex?

A 'format' is a director or zip file which is:
  - Located in the _quarto directory
  - Format YAML (must declare base)
  - Arbitrary other files that can be referenced (relatively) by the format YAML

Port a dozen or rticles formats
  - Authors metadata standard 

# markdown for bootstrap concepts/constructs
# standalone document formats
bs4-notebook
bs4-article
bs4-website
bs4-book

- Installer

- WordPress (https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/)

- Port tinytex to JS; OR we need to implmeent various auto-install behaviors for latexmk, eg.
  had to do this to get biblatex working w/ latexmk
  (may want to automate installation if no biber + auto-map TinyTeX to path)
    tlmgr install biblatex
    tlmgr install biber
    ln -sf /Users/jjallaire/Library/TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-darwin/biber /usr/local/bin/biber
Note need to implement tinytex: false and tinytex options (e.g. min-runs, clean, output-dir, etc.)


v0.1
-----------------------------------------

- Basic docs (could even be private)
 

Pandoc-powered academic, scientific, and technical publishing. Quarto is pandoc plus:
1) Integrated output from R, Python, and Julia via seamless integration with knitr and Jupyter
2) Ciations via pandoc citeproc
3) Cross references for figures, tables, equations, sections, listings, proofs, and more.
4) Sophisticated figure layout
5) Long form publishing (websites, books, manuscripts, etc.)


Future
-----------------------------------------




- RStudio IDE Visual Editor for quarto
    - crossref system
    - project hooks (crossref indexing, build, etc.)
    - publishing hooks for RSC
    - jupyter front-end


- Visual Studio Code 
    - visual editor extension
    - quarto publishing workflow (preview, etc.)

Cleanup
--------------------------------------------

Extracate the cache dir logic from rmarkdown::render and call that

Merge -M and --metadata-file with _quarto.yml and in-file YAML with same
semantics as Pandoc

discover index.Rmd or ui.Rmd for quarto run. can't rely on
rmarkdown::run b/c we need to figure out which Rmd to render

Meta-concepts on top of AST: e.g. tabs



Future
---------------------------------------------

- Consider yaml for chunk options
    * knitr
    * jupytext pr
