TODO:

Figures
-------------------------

- animations

- tikz

- test w/ htmlwidgets

- What to do about the code chunk(s) that are dropped in a figure panel
  (perhaps just hoist them up before the div and force fig.hold for panels?)

- Compute actual page width for custom reference.docx
- Consider page-width for panels to force a width
- ODT tables? RTF tables? (table "row" separator and custom caption centering)


- investigate agggregate figures (embedded tables, etc.)

- Consider multiple tables in single environment? 
  https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/How_to_Write_a_Thesis_in_LaTeX_(Part_3):_Figures,_Subfigures_and_Tables#Subtables

- Implement latex environment divs: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html

Quarto
---------------------------

- Generally, validity of labels (don't want under the hood transformations to 
  affect addressabilty)

- Should we convert include-in-header to header-includes (or vice versa) to eliminate the conflict
  (command line options overwrite metadata options)
- see http://lierdakil.github.io/pandoc-crossref/#latex-output-and---include-in-header
- Injected HTML in meta.lua gets overridden whenever we use include-in-header in the
defaults file (e.g. for  htmlwidgets). Use temp file?

Project system:
  - allow _quarto config directory that merges all contained files
    (lock file will go there as well)
  - See MkDocs: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Lp39BolpTR0NzbQQ6ebr9bawYth8EeivBo0q4qapVY/edit#heading=h.ibf8kici39py
  - Terminate at _quarto.yml w/ project: true
    (need to first determine if there is a project somewhere in the parent tree,
     if there is, then use this behavior, if not, use the first match)
  - External interactions with projects (output_dir, clean, etc.)
  - website / book format variations

  
LaTeX
---------------------------

- We don't seem to be able to render latex quite the same way that knitr does,
e.g.:
library(flextable)
ft <- flextable(head(mtcars))
ft <- autofit(ft)
ft
- Why did Beamer fail to render w/ missing caption package w/ our pipeline but work for pandoc pdflatex?

Port tinytex to JS; OR we need to implmeent various auto-install behaviors for latexmk, eg.
  had to do this to get biblatex working w/ latexmk
  (may want to automate installation if no biber + auto-map TinyTeX to path)
    tlmgr install biblatex
    tlmgr install biber
    ln -sf /Users/jjallaire/Library/TinyTeX/bin/x86_64-darwin/biber /usr/local/bin/biber
Note need to implement tinytex: false and tinytex options (e.g. min-runs, clean, output-dir, etc.)


v0.1
-----------------------------------------

- Basic docs (could even be private)
 
- Installer

Pandoc-powered scientific and technical publishing. Quarto is pandoc plus:
1) Integreated computations via Rmd or Jupyter
2) Ciations via pandoc citeproc
3) Cross references for figures, tables, equations, sections, listings, proofs, and more.
4) Sophisticated figure layout
5) Long form publishing (websites, books, manuscripts, etc.)


Future
-----------------------------------------

# Package/extension system

Port a dozen or rticles formats
# markdown for bootstrap concepts/constructs
# standalone document formats
bs4-notebook
bs4-article
bs4-website
bs4-book

    - crossref system
    - project hooks (crossref indexing, build, etc.)
    - publishing hooks for RSC
    - jupyter front-end


- Visual Studio Code 
    - visual editor extension
    - quarto publishing workflow (preview, etc.)

Cleanup
--------------------------------------------

Extracate the cache dir logic from rmarkdown::render and call that

Merge -M and --metadata-file with _quarto.yml and in-file YAML with same
semantics as Pandoc

discover index.Rmd or ui.Rmd for quarto run. can't rely on
rmarkdown::run b/c we need to figure out which Rmd to render

Meta-concepts on top of AST: e.g. tabs
