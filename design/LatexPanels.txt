Use minipage (with \begin{figure} or a custom float) for pure layout
Use subfig (subfloat) for widely compatible figure layout (controlling width via includegraphics)
Use subcaption for nicer but less compatible figure layout (controlling width via includegraphics)

Side by side tables appear to have no width capability (layout needs to "work").
We *can* do sized tables via minipage/subcaption:
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/2832/how-can-i-have-two-tables-side-by-side (note use of %)

Note use % in between subfigures or mini pages to indicate "no space" so stay on same line

Could % work with plain tabular?

Consider width=0.9\linewidth for included graphics to provide some spacing?



latex subfloat control width

latex minipage control width

\usepackage{subfig}


## subfig package (compatible)
   - Section 4.2 (create custom subfloats)
   - 

subfig package
\subfloat[<caption><label>] {


}

## subcaption package

\begin{figure}
\minipage 
  \subcaption


## Pure layout:

\begin{figure}
\minipage


Perhaps we could get tables with subcaptions working with just minipage, caption:

\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{subfig}
\usepackage[capitalize]{cleveref}

\begin{document}

We show two images \cref{fig:sub1} and \cref{fig:sub2} below.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{minipage}[t]{.5\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{cat1.jpeg}
        \caption{caption 1}
        \label{fig:sub1}
    \end{minipage}%
    \begin{minipage}[t]{.5\textwidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{cat2.jpeg}
        \caption{caption 2}
        \label{fig:sub2}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\end{document}

- Consider multiple tables in single environment?

- knitr uses subfloat (would want this via the subfig package)

http://ctan.math.utah.edu/ctan/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/subfig.pdf (compat w/ journals referenced below)

See minipage as alternative! (subcaption can work w/ that)
for pure layout, we may just want an uncaptioned figure w/ embedded minipage

A useful extension is the subcaption[6] package, which uses subfloats within a single float. The subfig package 
(subfigure package is deprecated[5]) is a useful alternative when used in-conjunction with LaTeX templates (i.e. 
templates for journals from Springer and IOP, IEEETran and ACM SIG) that are not compatible with subcaption. 
These packages give the author the ability to have subfigures within figures, or subtables within table floats. 
Subfloats have their own caption, and an optional global caption. An example will best illustrate the usage of 
the subcaption package:

Also see (figure spacing):
Horizontal spaces between figures are controlled by one of several commands, which are placed in between \begin{subfigure} and \end{subfigure}:
A non-breaking space (specified by ~ as in the example above) can be used to insert a space in between the subfigs.
Math spaces: \qquad, \quad, \;, and \,
Generic space: \hspace{''length''}
Automatically expanding/contracting space: \hfill
