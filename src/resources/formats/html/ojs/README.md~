# Notes on the Quarto OJS runtime

We use a bundled JS module to package all of the required JS for
the OJS integration in quarto.

## A single bundle file is needed

Although ES modules are very convenient to program in, they break the
fancy conversion of javascript resources into data URLs that is
necessary for self-contained files, specifically in that local imports
can be specified in javascript code, and those do not get translated
into data URLs themselves (perhaps in the future this could be done
via an exceedingly fancy import map trick?)

## Building

We use esbuild to create esbuild-bundle.js, a single JS module which
combines all of the necessary local JS into a single file.
