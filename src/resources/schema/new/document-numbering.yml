    short: "Number section headings"
    long: |
      Number section headings rendered ouptut. By default, sections are not numbered.
      Sections with class `.unnumbered` will never be numbered, even if `number-sections`
      is specified.

    short: The depth to which sections should be numbered.
    long: |
      By default, all headings in your document create a 
      numbered section. You customize numbering depth using 
      the `number-depth` option. 

      For example, to only number sections immediately below 
      the chapter level, use this:

      ```yaml  
      number-depth: 1
      ```

      Offset for section headings in output (offsets are 0 by default)
      The first number is added to the section number for
      top-level headings, the second for second-level headings, and so on.
      So, for example, if you want the first top-level heading in your
      document to be numbered "6", specify `number-offset: 5`. If your
      document starts with a level-2 heading which you want to be numbered
      "1.5", specify `number-offset: [1,4]`. Implies `number-sections`

      Shift heading levels by a positive or negative integer. For example, with 
      `shift-heading-level-by: -1`, level 2 headings become level 1 headings.
    long: |
      Shift heading levels by a positive or negative integer.
      For example, with `shift-heading-level-by: -1`, level 2
      headings become level 1 headings, and level 3 headings
      become level 2 headings.  Headings cannot have a level
      less than 1, so a heading that would be shifted below level 1
      becomes a regular paragraph.  Exception: with a shift of -N,
      a level-N heading at the beginning of the document
      replaces the metadata title.
