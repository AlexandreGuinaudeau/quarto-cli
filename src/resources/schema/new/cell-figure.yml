      Width of the plot in the output document, which can be different from its physical `fig-width`,

      Depending on the output format, this option can take special values.
      For example, for LaTeX output, it can be `.8\\linewidth`, `3in`, or `8cm`;
      for HTML, it can be `300px`.

          high-level plots).
      -   `none`: Discard all plots.
      -   `all`: Keep all plots (low-level plot changes may produce new plots).
      -   `first`: Only keep the first plot.
      -   `last`: Only keep the last plot.
      -   If set to a numeric vector, the values are indices of (low-level) plots
          to keep.

      -   `hold`: Hold all plots and output them at the end of a code chunk.
      -   `animate`: Concatenate all plots into an animation if there are multiple
          plots in a chunk.
      -   `hide`: Generate plot files but hide them in the output document.

      Hook function to create animations in HTML output.

      Another hook function is `gifski` based on the
      [**gifski**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gifski) package to
      create GIF animations.
