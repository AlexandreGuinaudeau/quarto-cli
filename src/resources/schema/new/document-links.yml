      A regular expression that can be used to determine whether a link is an internal link. For example, 
      the following will treat links that start with http://www.quarto.org as internal links (and others
      will be considered external):

      ```
      ^(?:http:|https:)\/\/www\.quarto\.org\/custom
      ```
