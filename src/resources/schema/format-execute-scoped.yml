       Cache results of computations (using the [knitr cache](https://yihui.org/knitr/demo/cache/) 
       for R documents, and [Jupyter Cache](https://jupyter-cache.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
       for Jupyter documents).

       Note that cache invalidation is triggered by changes in chunk source code 
       (or other cache attributes you've defined). Use `refresh` to force a refresh
       of the cache even if has not been otherwise invalidated.

      Option to denote that computational documents should never be re-rendered during
      a global project render (`freeze: true`), or alternatively only be re-rendered
      when their source file changes (`freeze: auto`).

      Run Jupyter kernels within a peristent daemon (to mitigate kernel startup time).
      By default a daemon with a timeout of 300 seconds will be used. Set `daemon`
      to another timeout value or to `false` to disable it altogether.
