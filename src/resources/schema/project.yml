  # this is a hack so that we "support" an empty schema.
  # The value in the enum should never appear in actual documents.
  #
  # In order to provide a good error message, we need an error
  # to be reported with instancePath ["type"].
  # Tis is a hacky way to do it.
  #
  # In general, full json schema would allow negative assertions,
  # but that makes our error localization heuristics worse. So we hack.
