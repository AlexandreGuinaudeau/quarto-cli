      Specifies what to do with insertions, deletions, and comments
      produced by the MS Word "Track Changes" feature.  `accept` (the
      default) processes all the insertions and deletions.
      `reject` ignores them.  Both `accept` and `reject` ignore comments.
      `all` includes all insertions, deletions, and comments, wrapped
      in spans with `insertion`, `deletion`, `comment-start`, and
      `comment-end` classes, respectively. The author and time of
      change is included. `all` is useful for scripting: only
      accepting changes from a certain reviewer, say, or before a
      certain date. If a paragraph is inserted or deleted,
      `track-changes=all` produces a span with the class
      `paragraph-insertion`/`paragraph-deletion` before the
      affected paragraph break. This option only affects the docx
      reader.
