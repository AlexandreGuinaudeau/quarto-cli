# Configuring Your Environment
After cloning the repo, please run the `configure-<platform>` script appropriate for your platform. 
The script will download any dependencies and configure the 'quarto' command for your environment.

Please follow any other instructions provided by the configure `configure-<platform>` to complete configuration. (For example, on a Mac, you can run `./configure-macos.sh` in a terminal to setup the quarto command line tool).

Once you have completed that command, run the command `quarto --help` to confirm that all is well.
